I am a PhD candidate in biostatistics at UC Berkeley. I received a BA in mathematics and computer science from Cornell University in 1998. After working at the Center for Neuroscience at UC Davis, I came to UC Berkeley in 2000â€”first to design the data analysis system for the Brain Imaging Center and then as the director of research computing for the Neuroscience Institute.

At Berkeley, I cofounded the Neuroimaging in Python project. I was the NumPy and SciPy release manager from 2007 to 2009. I cofounded NumFOCUS and served on its board from 2011 to 2015. Currently, I am the release manager of NetworkX.

In 2015, I began the biostatistics PhD program. I am advised by Prasad Raghavendra and Sandrine Dudoit. My interests include algorithms, scientific computing, and neuroscience.

I am a Senior Open Source Scientific Python Developer at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu) (BIDS) at UC Berkeley.
My background is in computer science, mathematics, and statistics, with degrees from Cornell and Berkeley.
As a founding member of the scientific Python ecosystem, my primary focus is on the development and sustainability of open-source, community-owned scientific software tools.

I serve on the steering council of [NetworkX](https://networkx.org) and am a core developer of [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org).
In the past, I was an early contributor to [NumPy](https://numpy.org), [SciPy](https://scipy.org), and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org).
I co-founded several influential initiatives to advance open and reproducible research:

- The [Scientific Python](https://scientific-python.org/) project to better coordinate computational tools across scientific domains.
- The nonprofit [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/history) to promote open practices in research, data, and scientific computing.
- The [Neuroimaging in Python](https://nipy.org/) project to develop cutting-edge tools for brain imaging data analysis.

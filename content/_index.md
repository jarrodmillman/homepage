I am a Senior Open Source Scientific Python Developer at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley.
My background is in mathematics, computer science, and statistics, with degrees from Cornell and Berkeley.
As a founding member of the scientific Python ecosystem, my primary focus is on the development and sustainability of open-source, community-owned scientific software tools.

I was involved in the conceptualization of NumPy, and an early maintainer of SciPy and scikit-learn.
I am a core developer and steering council member of NetworkX and a core developer of scikit-image.
I co-founded:

- The [Scientific Python](https://scientific-python.org/) project to better coordinate computational tools across scientific domains.
- The nonprofit [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/history) to promote open practices in research, data, and scientific computing.
- The [Neuroimaging in Python](https://nipy.org/) project to develop cutting-edge tools for brain imaging data analysis.

These efforts underscore my dedication to fostering open collaboration, enhancing research reproducibility, and promoting greater computational literacy among researchers.
Driven by the belief in open-source software's role in transparent, reproducible, and accurate scientific research, my focus is on enhancing the infrastructure supporting these principles.

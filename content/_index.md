I am a Senior Open Source Scientific Python Developer at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu), UC Berkeley.
My background is in mathematics and and statistics, with degrees from Cornell and Berkeley.
As a founding member of the scientific Python ecosystem, my primary focus is on the development and long-term sustainability of open-source, community-owned software tools that support scientific research.

I co-founded:

- [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/history), a nonprofit that promotes sustainable high-level programming languages,
open code development, and reproducible scientific research.
- [NIPY](https://nipy.org/), the Neuroimaging in Python project, which develops cutting-edge tools for brain imaging data analysis.
- The [Scientific Python](https://scientific-python.org/) project, an umbrella effort to coordinate core computational tools across scientific domains.

Through these initiatives, I have championed open collaboration, software sustainability, and the democratization of data science to accelerate research breakthroughs.

I was involved in the conceptualization of NumPy, and an early maintainer of SciPy and scikit-learn.
I currently am a core developer and steering council member of NetworkX (a package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks) and a core developer of scikit-image (a package for image processing in Python).
I previously served on the steering council of SciPy.

Throughout my career, I've been driven by the idea that open-source software is a powerful tool for enabling and advancing transparent, reproducible, and accurate scientific research.
By contributing to the infrastructure that supports this work, and striving to make these tools accessible to a broad community, I hope to play a small part in pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.

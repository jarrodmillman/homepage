I am Jarrod Millman, a member of the scientific Python community known for my contributions to open-source software projects.
While I have a background in mathematics, computer science, and statistics, my primary focus has been on facilitating
the development and maintenance of open-source, community-owned software tools that support scientific research.

I have played a leadership role in several major open-source scientific Python projects and organizations.
I co-founded [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/history), a nonprofit that promotes sustainable high-level programming languages,
open code development, and reproducible scientific research.
Additionally, I co-founded the Neuroimaging in Python ([NIPY](https://nipy.org/)) project, which develops cutting-edge tools for brain imaging data analysis.
I was also instrumental in launching the [Scientific Python](https://scientific-python.org/) project, an umbrella effort to coordinate core computational tools across scientific domains.
Through these initiatives, I have championed open collaboration, software sustainability, and the democratization of data science to accelerate research breakthroughs.

I've also been involved with several other projects in the scientific Python ecosystem.
I am a core developer and a member of the steering council for NetworkX, a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.
I am currently a core developer of scikit-image.
Previously, I served on the steering council for SciPy and was the NumPy release manager and a core developer of scikit-learn.

Throughout my career, I've been driven by the idea that open-source software is a powerful tool for enabling and advancing scientific research.
By contributing to the infrastructure that supports this work, and striving to make these tools accessible to a broad community, I hope to play a small part in pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.
It's a challenging but deeply rewarding endeavor, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with so many talented and passionate individuals along the way.

<!--
I am a Senior Open Source Scientific Python Developer at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu) and co-founder of the [Scientific Python](https://scientific-python.org) project.
With a passion for data science and open-source software, I've dedicated my career to advancing the field through research, software development, and community engagement.

As an active contributor to the scientific Python ecosystem, I've been involved in various projects, including NumPy, SciPy, NetworkX, scikit-image, scikit-learn, and nipy.
My contributions range from core development to community outreach, aiming to make these powerful tools accessible to researchers and developers worldwide.

In addition to my contributions to open-source projects, I've also served in leadership roles, including as the President of the NumFOCUS board of directors.
In this capacity, I've championed sustainability and best practices within the scientific and research community, fostering a culture of community ownership and collaborative practice, where individuals actively engage in shaping and driving initiatives forward.

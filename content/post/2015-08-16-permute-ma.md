[Philip B. Stark](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark), [Kellie Ottoboni](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~kellieotto),
[Stéfan van der Walt](http://mentat.za.net), and I are developing a permutation
testing library for Python. The source code is available
[here](https://github.com/statlab/permute). More information about the package
is available in my [MA
thesis](http://www.jarrodmillman.com/publications/millman2015thesis.pdf).
